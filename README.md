# Overview
**PopoverEx** is an advanced Popover widget for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). After installation it becomes available in the Widgets list as a "native" widget and can be used as any other widget. The widget allows to position each item through coordinates on top of a main image and display content inside a dropdown.

## Features
### Basic Features
* **Collection of toggle icons** - you can choose a toggle icon from the predefined list.
* **Hover/Click behavior** - you can select how the widget will respond: the dropdown can be displayed when the user moves their mouse over the icon or when they click it.
* **Panel styles** - different panel styles for the dropdown.
* **Backward compatibility** - all other behavior, styling and features of the original [Popover widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/popover) are preserved.
* **Multilingual interface**, translated into languages:
	* **English** (en_GB)
	* **Русский** (ru_RU)
	* Your language not listed? You can help with translation, [read more](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-popover-ex/wiki/Translation-issues).

### Unique Features
The new features that the PopoverEx has and that are not available in the original Popover widget:

* **Custom Default Toggle Icon** - a custom icon can be set very easy from the control panel.
* **Responsive Toggle Icon** - you can setup the size and resize behavior of the icon.
* **Unique Icons for Every Item** - you can setup individual unique icons for any element.
* **Opacity control** - you can define the transparency level of the icons.
* **Tooltips for all options** - it's much easier to use the widget, because tooltips are available for all settings.
* **Update notifications** - you will be notified if new versions of the widget are available.
